If we can land a spaceship on the moon with precision accuracy then we should be able to count votes with precision accuracy. 

Here is list of open source voting systems and related ideas/materials that I have been gathering over the years. This probably should be in Wikipedia at some point. PRs welcome and anyone interested in helping review and merge!
